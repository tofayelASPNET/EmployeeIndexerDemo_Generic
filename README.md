👨‍💼 Employee Indexer Example – C# Project
This project demonstrates how to use indexers in C# to generically access and update object properties by index number. The class represents a simple Employee data model with multiple fields and an indexer that acts like an array accessor.

✅ Key Features
C# Class with Multiple Fields (_empId, _empName, _designation, _dName, _location, _salary)

Implements an indexer to get or set values by integer index

Allows generic access to internal data without directly referencing property names

Supports constructor overloading

🎯 Use Case
Helps understand indexers in C#

Demonstrates generic property access

Useful in cases where data needs to be accessed via position (like rows/columns or grid systems)

Can be used as the foundation for dynamic form handling, UI binding, or custom serialization
📦 Technologies Used
C# (.NET Core / .NET Framework)

Object-Oriented Programming Concepts (OOP)

Indexers

Console Application (or Library)
